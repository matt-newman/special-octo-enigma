This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### The other repo
Go here and build/run this first:
https://github.com/matt-newman/sturdy-succotash

### Getting Started

run the install for whichever node package manager you prefer, e.g:

```
npm i
```

Then, run the development server (as it dynamically assigns the port, so no conflicts):

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open the localhost address with your browser to see the result. Its likely to be [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) as the other project should be running on 3000

The home page has two links to example pages, 1 with a single eligable animal, and the other with 2 and that should also be eligable for the free
